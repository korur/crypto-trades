CRYPTO TRACKER!
Here, I converted the Crypto Trades D3 visualization from [Bob Hammell](https://github.com/rhammell/crypto-trades) into Svelte. 

You can find the running [demo](https://korur.netlify.app/crypto/tracker) on Svelte here. 

The app uses Coinbase Pro websocket to retrieve the real-time data and the Trades for various Crypto/USD pairs are displayed on a scrolling timeline. The size of the circles are in relation to the trade sizes. You can mouse over for the details.
